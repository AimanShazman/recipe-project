            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Make the burger patties. Combine meat, diced onion, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 
                    ketchup, Dijon mustard and salt & pepper in a large bowl. I use my hands to mix everything 
                    and ensure the ingredients are evenly dispersed. Do not over-mix the ingredients because this 
                    can cause tough burgers. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Press your thumb into the center of 
                    each patty to create a divot, so that when they cook, they stay flat and don't puff up. </p></li>

                <li><p>Cook the patties. Preheat a griddle, grill pan or large skillet on the stove or an outdoor 
                    grill. While that's heating, you can prepare the toppings and condiments: slice tomatoes, 
                    tear lettuce, slice the onion, etc. Cook the patties for about 4-6 minutes per side, until browned 
                    and internal temperature reaches 73°C. For cheeseburgers, add slices of cheese after the burger 
                    has been flipped to the second side and after about 2-3 minutes. Top each patty with a slice of 
                    cheese, cover and cook about 1-2 minute(s).</p></li>    

                <li><p>Toast buns. While the patties are still cooking, toast buttered hamburger buns in a 176°C 
                    oven until buns are warmed through and lightly crispy, about 5 minutes. You can also toast 
                    buttered buns on the grill for a few minutes with the burgers.</p></li>

                <li><p>Serve. Enjoy these ground chicken burgers served on buns with your favorite toppings and sauces!</p></li>
