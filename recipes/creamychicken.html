            <h1>Creamy Chicken</h1>
            <img src="../pictures/creamychicken.png">
            <p>This creamy garlic chicken is ready in about 30 minutes. It's good enough to serve company, 
            but it's also one of those dishes that works for a quick weeknight dinner. A lovely reader 
            said that it's "one of the best things I have ever eaten!!!" It was an early hit on the blog 
            and actually shaped the direction of S&L towards easy comfort food.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken - we're using two large boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise to cook 
                    faster and more evenly, so it remains tender and melt-in-your-mouth</li>
                <li>Flour - for a tasty crust on the exterior of the cutlets, and it also helps thicken the sauce</li>
                <li>Olive oil and butter - for saut√©ing</li>
                <li>Garlic cloves - use an entire head of garlic. Don't worry if you don't have the exact same number 
                    of cloves as I used. It's not precise.</li>
                <li>Chicken broth - for the savory base of the sauce</li>
                <li>Lemon juice - a little bit of acidity for balance</li>
                <li>Garlic powder - for a different garlicky aspect! It's a staple in my pantry.</li>
                <li>Heavy cream - it's what makes the sauce luxuriously rich</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Cut the chicken breasts into four cutlets, season with salt & pepper, and coat with flour. Pan 
                    fry until golden, and then take them out of the skillet. </p></li>
                <li><p>Lightly brown the garlic cloves in the same pan.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the broth, lemon juice, and garlic powder to the skillet. Let it up bubble for a few minutes 
                    until the liquid has reduced somewhat.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pour in the cream, and return the chicken to the pan to cook until it reaches 165F inside and the 
                    sauce thickens.</p></li>
                <li><p>Garnish with parsley if desired.</p></li>
            </ol>
