                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp oil</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Pat dry - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</p></li>
                <li><p>Season generously - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</p></li>
                <li><p>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</p></li>
                <li><p>Sear steaks - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to 
                    turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</p></li>
                <li><p>Add butter and aromatics - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to 
                    spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</p></li>
                <li><p>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</p></li>
